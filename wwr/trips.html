        <h2> Who Are We?</h2>
        <p> We are Gravity Adventures, a once-in-a-lifetime athletic service that offers white water rafting. Our goal is to provide our rafters a memorable and safe experience. 
        Our business was founded in the 1980s, just following the Olympics. Since then, we have been offering thrills and family enjoyment to anybody brave enough to cross the Ocoee River.
